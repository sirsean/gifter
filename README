Gifter randomly assigns gift givers and receivers, for the times when you want to give gifts without having to figure out who's giving to whom on your own.

The gimmick here is that there are multiple families, and intra-family gifts are not allowed. Say you're going to a Christmas party, with your family and another family. You all want to exchange gifts, but you don't want to give a gift to someone in your own family. Gifter is for you.

    mv gifter.yaml.template gifter.yaml
    ruby gifter.rb

The gifter.yaml file represents a hash of families, where the keys are family names and the values are arrays of the names of the family members. For example:

    First Family:
        - "Name 1"
        - "Name 2"
        - "Name 3"
    Second Family:
        - "Name 4"
        - "Name 5"
        - "Name 6"

Adjust that file accordingly.
